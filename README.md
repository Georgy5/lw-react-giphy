# react-boilerplate

Simple react starter with the following config:

- React, ReactDOM
- Webpack 5
- Babel with react presets
- Bootstrap (css only, loaded from a cdn in `index.html`)
- main `application.scss` stylesheet is imported in `index.js` as a module to enjoy hot reloading

## Scripts

To start the local Webpack Dev Server (usually on port `8080`):

```bash
yarn start
```

To lint all JavaScript files in the `src` folder:

```bash
yarn lint
```
